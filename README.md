#Auto Mouse Mover Bot

This light app uses a long running thread to keep any machine awake.
Mouse interrupts are sent at user defined intervals to the OS.

Keep sessions active. Prevent VPN disconnections. Or just pretend to be working ;)

Perfect if your network admin has a domain policy that locks/hibernates/shuts-down your machine after some time of inactivity.
